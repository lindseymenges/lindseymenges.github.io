                    <p>Born in California and raised in the gorgeous state of Colorado, Lindsey recently felt her birthplace calling and relocated to the Bay Area, along with her husband and her puppy, to pursue a career in the tech world.
                    <br>
                    Lindsey spent her academic career as a psychology major, but then went through the hacker school Dev Bootcamp where she learned how to code.
                    <br>
                    She lives in the South Bay and loves working as a front-end developer.</p>

                    <p>But that’s not all! Lindsey has self-published a book (a sci-fi young adult dystopian novel titled “Death Wish”), and is currently writing the sequel, “Thanatos”.
                    <br>
                    She is also a self-taught lover of nail art, and runs her own website <a href="http://nailsfornickels.com">Nails for Nickels</a> with photos and tutorials of her own lovely (and occasionally nerdy!) nail art.
                    <br>
                    In her spare time Lindsey loves to read, write, hike, lift heavy things at CrossFit, and drink copious amounts of coffee. Yep, it was only a matter of time before she became a bonafide Californian.</p>
